#### User Story ðŸ“–

> AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform     
> I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
> SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem  

#### Acceptance Criteria âœ…

> GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
> WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
> THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
> WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
> THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
> WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
> THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
> WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
> THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
> WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
> THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
